# Event Extraction from Crime News Articles Headlines

This project is designed to extract events related to crime from news articles headlines obtained through the News API. It uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to gather knowledge about periodical incidents found in texts, automatically identifying information about what happened and when it happened.

## Getting Started 
Before running the code, you need to have a News API key to access the headlines from the news API. You can get the API key from [https://newsapi.org/].<br>
To get started, clone the repository and install the required packages using the following command:<br>
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage
Now you can open the jupyter-notebook and run the cells to perform the event extraction task. I have stored the data that I acquired from news-api in ```newsapi_crime_data.csv```. <br>
If you want to access the live crime news articles, you can get the key of news-api and run the functions related to it provided in jupyter-notebook.
